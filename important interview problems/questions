-Bottom up traversal of a tree

-Given list of files and folders, check if they are valid based on your directory structure for eg. /user/desktop/abc.txt - if this file is present then return yes else create a relevant directory 
accordingly and create a new file abc.txt in that directory.

-Maximum elements in window of size k - sliding window, deque solution expected

-zig zag order traversal - one stack solution expected

-social networking edge ranking algorithm - graph approach expected

- Implement LRU Cache - all approaches

- Coin Change DP - all Variations

- Rabin Karp, KMP - Substring Search (Google, HT Media, Wingify asked this to me)

- Phone Keypad DP Problem

- Search Subtree in a tree

- Kadane's Algo and its variations

- Detect and Remove loop in a linkedlist (never give floyd's solution, always give hashmap approach)

- Longest Repeating Character Replacement (Google asked this)

- Maximum points on a line (Most favorite question)

- Maths of Trees (Height, Balancing, Depth of a node) (If you love trees, then go in depth of maths of trees, two companies asked me to prove sum of GP equation)
